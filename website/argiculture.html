            <h2>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
            <p> The agricultural data ofAndhra Pradesh between 2014 and 2019 that i extraces which contains coloums crops, districts, seasons, and yields. However,every data was not perfect contains  inconsistencies,missing values etc..in rows and columns. some rows with missing values of production and yield were removed. using box plots i detceted the outliers of most produced crops in andharapradesh like in west godavari rice the top cultivated crop i find the boxplot of yeild,production in kharif and rabi  and removed outliers of the crops.</p>

            <h2>Data Exploration:</h1>
            <h2>Chapter 1: The Reign of Rice</h2>
            
            
            <p>Rice, the king of Andhra Pradesh's crops, ruled with unwavering dominance. In districts like West Godavari and East Godavari, rice fields stretched as far as the eye could see. Year after year:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>West Godavari produced staggering yields, peaking at 160000 tonnes in 2014  and maintaining its throne with over 1750,000 tonnes by 2019.</li>
                <img src="images\15.png" alt="Rice Field 1">
                <li>The secret to rice's success? The Rabi season. With irrigation systems in place,  as the years rolled by, Rabi emerged as the champion season for rice, painting a picture of innovation and irrigation triumphs.                    , painting a picture of resilience and abundance.</li>
                <img src="images\1.png" alt="Rice Field 2">
                
                <li>But not all was perfect in this kingdom. In districts like Visakhapatnam, rice struggled with lower yields (2.1–2.5 tonnes/hectare), reminding us that even kings face challenges.</li>

            <h2>Chapter 2: The Groundnut Gamble</h2>
            <img src="images\3.png" alt="Rice Field 1">
            <p>In Anantapur, groundnut was more than a crop—it was a way of life. With vast tracts of land dedicated to it (around 600000 hectares in 2016 ), groundnut was the district’s pride. Yet, its story was bittersweet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>but their efforts often yielded heartbreakingly low returns. Yields hovered around 0.9 tonnes/hectare, a stark reminder of the challenges posed by erratic rainfall and poor soil conditions.

                    But hope was not lost. By 2017, yields climbed to 1.5 tonnes/hectare, showing that with better water management and farming techniques, even Anantapur could rewrite its story.
                </li>
                <img src="images\2.png" alt="Rice Field 1">
                <li>Despite its challenges, groundnut remained a symbol of hope for Anantapur’s farmers.</li>

            <p>Cotton’s tale unfolded with drama and triumphs. In Guntur, cotton reached legendary heights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the bustling district of Guntur, cotton ruled supreme. The year 2014 was a golden one, with record-breaking yields of around 5 tonnes/hectare during Rabi. Cotton became synonymous with wealth here, as Guntur's farmers mastered the art of maximizing output </li>
                
                <img src="images\4.png"alt="Rice Field 1">
                <li>Even as yields dipped slightly in subsequent years, Guntur remained Andhra Pradesh’s cotton capital.</li>
                <li>But cotton wasn't just Guntur's pride—it spread its roots to Krishna and Kurnool, where yields consistently around 3 tonnes/hectare upto 2017 and yields dipped slightly in subsequent years. It was clear: cotton wasn’t just a crop; it was a legacy.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li> the southern district  Chittoor, sugarcane plantations stretched as far as the eye could see. In 2014, Chittoor produced over 2 million tonnes of sugarcane—a testament to its fertile soil and hardworking farmers. Yields consistently hovered around an impressive 79-80 tonnes/hectare, making Chittoor the sweet heartland of Andhra Pradesh.

                    Meanwhile, vizag, sugarcane production reached an astonishing peak of over 2 million tonnes over the years, cementing its place as another sugarcane powerhouse.

            <h2>Chapter 7: Seasonal Struggles</h2>
            <p>The seasons played a pivotal role in shaping Andhra Pradesh’s agricultural landscape:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The battle between Kharif (monsoon) and Rabi (winter) seasons played out across every crop category:

                    For rice, groundnut and cotton, Rabi emerged victorious with higher yields due to controlled irrigation.
                    
                    For crops like chillies, Kharif remained dominant but highly dependent on monsoon rains</li>

                <li>Innovation is essential: Investments in irrigation and high-yield crop varieties paid off handsomely.</li>
